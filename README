fast_xml_serializer uses libxml to serialize ActiveRecord objects to xml.

In addition to being faster than Builder for rendering, it also caches column
types sensibly and is generally more efficient than the built-in
ActiveRecord::Base#to_xml


It defines two new methods:

  ActiveRecord::Base#to_xml_doc
  and
  ActiveRecord::Base.instances_to_xml


To use these methods in your controller, you would do something like:


class UsersController

  # GET /users
  def index
    respond_to do |format|
      format.xml do
        render :xml => User.instances_to_xml(@users, to_xml_parameters)
      end
    end
  end

  # GET /users/:id
  def show
    respond_to do |format|
      format.xml do
        render :xml => @user.to_xml_doc.to_s
      end
    end
  end
end
